\begin{abstract}
  This writeup acts as a sketch of a presentation on topological
  combinatorics given for Math 2240 at Cornell. We hope present one
  potential answer to the question of ``why topology?" by connecting
  two seemingly disparate areas of mathematics: combinatorics (where
  we work with the discrete) and topology (where we work with the
  continuous). Broadly, the talk begins with a general introduction to
  topology, setting up the neccesary machinary to state and prove the
  famous \emph{Borsuk-Ulam} theorem (Theorem \ref{main}), and
  continues to discuss its various combinatorial applications.

    Much of the material from this talk comes from \cite{topcombi}.

    \section{Borsuk-Ulam \& Alternate Formulations}

    Naturally, let's start with vocab.

    \begin{dfn}
    The $n$-sphere $\mathbb S^n$ is the subset $$\{\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^{n+1} \mid |x| = 1\}$$ of $\mathbb R^{n+1}$. Similarly, $B^n$ is the unit ball centered around $\mathbf 0$, i.e. $\{\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^n \mid |x| \leq 1\}$.
    \end{dfn}

    \begin{dfn}
        Two points $\mathbf x, \mathbf y \in \mathbb S^n$ are antipodal if $\mathbf x = -\mathbf y$, i.e. they're on diametrically opposite ends of the sphere. A map $f: \mathbb S^n \to X$ is antipodal (or odd) if $f(-x) = -f(x)$.
    \end{dfn}

    Note that the superscripts of $\mathbb S^n$ and $B^n$ denote the dimensions of our sets, not the dimension of the space they live in. I.e. the boundary of $B^n$ is $S^{n-1}$, not $S^n$.
=======
We assume no more than familiarity with the standard Euclidean
topology in $\mathbb R^n$.

\begin{thm}[Borsuk-Ulam]
  \label{main}
  Given a continuous map $f: \mathbb S^n \to \mathbb R^n$, $f$
  identifies two antipodal points: i.e.
  $\exists \mathbf x \in \mathbb S^n$ such that
  $f(\mathbf x) = f(-\mathbf x)$.
\end{thm}

<<<<<<< HEAD
    While originally formualted by Stanislaw Ulam, the first proof of Theorem \ref{main} was given by Karol Borsuk. Since then Borsuk-Ulam has found a number of equivalent formulations, proofs, and applications both at the heart and entirely away from topology. Ultimately, we only hope to present of small slice this. For a comprehensive treatment, see \cite{stein}.

    \begin{ex}
        The one dimension case is boils down to IVT. For $f: \mathbb S^1 \to \mathbb R$, consider $F(x) = f(x) - f(-x)$. Notice that our problem reduces to looking for the zeros of $F$. Now, pick some $x \in \mathbb S^1$. If $F(x) = 0$, we're done. Otherwise, $F(x)$ and $F(-x)$ have differing signs by the antipodality of $F$. Hence, IVT gives the existence of $y \in \mathbb S^1$ such that $F(y) = 0 \implies f(y) = f(-y)$. 
    \end{ex}

    By law, all talks about Borsuk-Ulam must present the following example.

    \begin{ex}
        Since temprature and pressure vary continuously across the earth, mapping each place to it's temprature-pressure pair on the plane gives a map $f: \mathbb S^2 \to \mathbb R^2$. Hence, there exists two antipodal points on the earth with the same temprature and pressure.
    \end{ex}

    Let's see some equivalent forms!

    \begin{thm}[Equivalent Formulations]
        \label{equiv}
        For $n \geq 0$, the following are equivalent and true:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Borusk-Ulam, Theorem \ref{main}.
            \item For antipodal $f: \mathbb S^n \to \mathbb R^n$, there exists $\mathbf x \in \mathbb S^n$ such that $f(\mathbf x) = 0$.
            \item There does not exist an antipodal map $f: \mathbb S^n \to \mathbb S^{n-1}$.
            \item There does not exist $f: B^n \to \mathbb S^n$ that is antipodal on the boundary.
            \item For any cover $F_1,\ldots,F_{n+1}$ of the sphere $\mathbb S^n$ by $n+1$ closed sets, there is at least one set containing a pair of antipodal points.
            \item For any cover $U_1,\ldots,U_{n+1}$ of the sphere $\mathbb S^n$ by $n+1$ open sets, there is at least one set containing a pair of antipodal points.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{thm}

    \begin{proof} We'll proceed by $(1) \iff (2) \iff (3) \iff (4)$.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[$(1) \implies (2)$] For antipodal $f$, there exists $\mathbf x$ such that $$f(\mathbf x) = f(-\mathbf x) = -f(\mathbf x) \implies f(\mathbf x) = 0.$$
            \item[$(2) \implies (1)$] For continuous $f$, $F(x) = f(x) - f(-x)$ is antipodal so there exists $\mathbf x$ such that $$F(\mathbf x) = 0 \implies f(\mathbf x) = -f(-\mathbf x).$$
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}

    Finally, we'll prove the $n=2$ case. While the higher dimensional cases aren't excessively technical, we'll skip it to stay within time. See \cite[ch 2]{topcombi} (or the appendix if I add it later) for the full proof.

    \begin{proof}[Proof of Borsuk-Ulam for $n=2$]

    \end{proof}

    An easy yet powerful consequence of Borsuk-Ulam is the Brower fixed point theorem:
    \begin{thm}
        \label{brower}
        For any convex compact $K \subseteq \mathbb R^n$, a map $K \to K$ has a fixed point.
    \end{thm}

    We don't actually have to work at the leval of generality of Theorem \ref{brower}.

    \begin{lem}
        Every convex compact subset of $\mathbb R^n$ is homeomorphic to the unit ball, $B^n$.
    \end{lem}

\section{Hex Game}

The game of Hex is played between two players, say Red and Green. Each
of them takes turns coloring a finite hexagonal grid. After all
hexagons are colored, Red wins if there's a red path connecting the
top and bottom, and Green wins if there's a green path connecting the
left and right.

    \begin{rem}
      Play a game after introducing Hex give a feel for the problem
      (if time permits).

    \begin{thm}
      Hex can never end in a tie.

    \section{Fair Division}

    Suppose you and a friend steal an open necklace, engraved with $m$
    precious stones. There are $d$ kinds of stones (labelled
    $1,\ldots,d$), an even number of each kind. Neither you nor your
    co-conspirator know the values of the different stone
    types. Hence, you decide to split the stones between each of you
    such that you both have the same number of jewels of each kind.

        Akash and those labelled $S$ go to Sid. Our necklace has $14$
        stones of $4$ types and was split using $4$ cuts.}
    \end{figure}

    Instead of removing the individual stones one by one, you decide
    to split the jewels by making as few cuts as possible to the
    necklace, divvying out the remaining strands between yourselves.

    \begin{thm}
      The minimal number of cuts needed is at most $d$.
    \end{thm}

    \begin{proof}
      At its current state, there isn't any good way to apply
      Borsuk-Ulam on our puzzle. Let's change that! We'll consider the
      interval $[0,m]$ as our neckalce. Break $[0,m]$ into the union
      of subintervals
      $$\bigcup_{k=0}^{m-2} \left[k, k+1\right) \cup \left[m-1,
        m\right].$$ The $k$th stone corresponds to the $k$th
      subinterval. Then, define characteristic functions for the
      stones as $f_i:[0,m] \to \{0,1\}$ for $i \in [d]$ such
      that
      $$f_i(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & x \in [k-1, k) \text{ and the $k$th
          stone is of type $i$}\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}.$$
      Fix
      $0 = z_0 \leq z_1 \leq z_2 \leq \cdots \leq z_d \leq m= z_{d+1}$
      to act as the cuts on our string. If we wish to assign the part
      $[z_i,z_{i-1}]$ ($i = 1, \ldots, d+1$) to the first thief, set
      $x_i = \left(\sqrt{z_{i} - z_{i-1}}\right)/m$ and
      $x_i = -\left(\sqrt{z_i - z_{i-1}}\right)/m$ otherwise. The
      tupple $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{d+1}) \in \mathbb S^d$ encodes a cut
      of the necklace. Noting that $z_j = \sum_{i=1}^{j} m^2x_i^2$,
      consider the continuous map
      $$(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{d+1}) \to \left(\sum_{j=1}^{d+1}
        \mathrm{sign}(x_j) \int_{[z_j,z_{j-1}]} f_1(x) \; \mathrm{d}x
        , \ldots, \sum_{j=1}^{d+1} \mathrm{sign}(x_j)
        \int_{[z_j,z_{j-1}]} f_d(x) \; \mathrm{d}x\right).$$ Since $f$
      is antipodal, theorems \ref{main} and \ref{} tell us
      $\exists \mathbf x \in \mathbb S^n$ such that
      $f(\mathbf x) = 0$. The cut associated $\mathbf x$ is a fair
      division.

      However, we might run into a problem translating this back into
      the discrete case! What if some $z_i$ associated with
      $\mathbf x$ lies in $\left(k, k+1\right)$ for some
      $k \in \mathbb Z$? (I.e. we cut partially into one of the
      jewels.) Given a non-integral cut subdividing a stone of type
      $i$, where a portion of stone $i$ is assigned to the first
      thief, we know our cut is either unneccesary or there exists at
      least one other partial cut into stones of type $i$ assigned to
      thief one since the sums of lengths of stone $i$ intervals is an
      integer. In the latter case, we can move the first
      ``non-integral" cut to the right and the remaining to the left,
      without changing the loot for each thief.
    \end{proof}
